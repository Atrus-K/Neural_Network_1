# Neural_Network_1
A brisk foray into the world of neural networks, using the MNIST data set to teach a neural network to read numbers.

Simply out of pure boredom I'm aiming to develop a neural network as " from scratch" as possible. In an attempt to grasp how they work to a better extent (from an implemented point of view).

Throughout this project I aim to use this README as an explaination, and a diary of sorts to jot down general processes, and things learnt whilst partaking in this adventure!
