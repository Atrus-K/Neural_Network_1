# Neural_Network_1
A brisk foray into the world of neural networks, using the MNIST data set to teach a neural network to read numbers.

Simply out of pure boredom I'm aiming to develop a neural network as " from scratch" as possible. In an attempt to grasp how they work to a better extent (from an implemented point of view).

Throughout this project I aim to use this README as an explaination, and a diary of sorts to jot down general processes, and things learnt whilst partaking in this adventure!

This is mostly learning how they work

I am aiming to build a neural network at the end of it that can read numbers, this will be using the MNIST data set.

might want to look at 3blue1brown's series on neural networks. It's relatively math heavy but it really helped me to understand backpropagation more intuitively
